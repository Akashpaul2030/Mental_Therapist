The primary and secondary objectives of the Mindful Companion chatbot are as follows:

- To provide factually accurate, empathetic, and ethically safe responses to users seeking mental health support.
- To integrate advanced AI technologies, specifically RAG, with established mental health best practices and curated knowledge.
- To offer personalized support by remembering user preferences, triggers, and conversation history, tailoring responses accordingly.
- To maintain strict ethical guidelines, prioritizing user privacy, data safety, and responsible AI interaction.
- To provide immediate access to crisis hotlines and emergency resources for users identified as being in acute distress.
- To encourage users to seek diagnosis, treatment, and ongoing care from licensed mental health professionals when appropriate, acting as a supportive tool rather than a replacement.
- To actively filter harmful or inappropriate content to maintain a safe and supportive environment for all users.

## 3. Target Users

The Mindful Companion chatbot is designed for individuals seeking accessible and immediate mental health support, guidance, and information. This includes, but is not limited to:

- Individuals experiencing symptoms of common mental health concerns such as anxiety, stress, or low mood, who are looking for initial support or coping strategies.
- Users who may be hesitant to seek traditional therapy or are looking for a supplementary tool to complement their existing mental health care.
- People seeking a confidential space to explore their feelings and gain insights based on evidence-based psychological principles (e.g., CBT techniques).
- Users in need of quick access to information about mental health topics or crisis resources.
- Individuals looking for personalized support that adapts to their stated concerns and preferences over time.

The chatbot is not intended for individuals in acute, severe crisis requiring immediate medical or psychiatric intervention (though it will guide them to such resources), nor is it a replacement for diagnosis or treatment by qualified healthcare professionals.
