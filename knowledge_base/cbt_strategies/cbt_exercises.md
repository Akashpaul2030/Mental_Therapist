# CBT Exercises and Coping Strategies

## Cognitive Restructuring Techniques

### Identifying Cognitive Distortions
Common cognitive distortions include:
- All-or-nothing thinking: Seeing things in black and white categories
- Catastrophizing: Expecting the worst possible outcome
- Overgeneralization: Viewing a single negative event as a never-ending pattern
- Mental filtering: Focusing exclusively on negative aspects while ignoring positives
- Discounting positives: Rejecting positive experiences as "not counting"
- Jumping to conclusions: Making negative interpretations without evidence
- Emotional reasoning: Believing something is true because it "feels" true
- "Should" statements: Having rigid rules about how you and others should behave
- Labeling: Attaching a negative label to yourself or others
- Personalization: Blaming yourself for events not entirely under your control

### Thought Record Exercise
1. Identify the situation: Describe the event, thought, or memory that led to unpleasant emotion
2. Note your emotions: Rate intensity (0-100%)
3. Identify automatic thoughts: What went through your mind?
4. Find evidence: List evidence that supports and contradicts the thought
5. Develop alternative perspective: Create a balanced thought based on all evidence
6. Re-rate emotions: Rate intensity of emotions after completing the exercise

## Behavioral Activation

2. Rate each activity for pleasure and mastery (sense of accomplishment)
3. Schedule specific activities into your week
4. After completing each activity, note your mood before and after
5. Gradually increase activities that improve your mood

### Graded Exposure
For anxiety-provoking situations:
1. Create a hierarchy of feared situations (rate anxiety 0-100%)
2. Start with situations that cause mild anxiety
3. Practice staying in the situation until anxiety decreases
4. Move to more challenging situations as you build confidence
5. Use relaxation techniques during exposure

## Mindfulness Practices

## Stress Management Techniques

### Progressive Muscle Relaxation
