# Mental Health Chatbot

A mental health chatbot using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide factually accurate, empathetic, and ethically safe responses.

## Overview

This chatbot retrieves information from a curated mental health knowledge base and responds in a supportive tone while adhering to crisis protocols and privacy standards. It uses vector databases with embeddings to index verified mental health resources and generates responses grounded in retrieved documents.

## Features

- **Knowledge Base Integration**: Uses vector databases (FAISS/Chroma) with embeddings to index verified mental health resources
- **Empathetic Response Generation**: Generates responses with an empathetic and non-judgmental tone
- **Crisis Detection**: Implements protocols for detecting and responding to crisis situations
- **Ethical Guidelines**: Includes disclaimers, avoids medical diagnoses, and uses moderation APIs

## Technical Implementation

The chatbot is built using:
- LangChain for orchestrating the RAG pipeline
- Vector databases (FAISS/Chroma) for knowledge retrieval
- OpenAI's embeddings and language models
- Crisis detection mechanisms
- HIPAA/GDPR compliance measures
